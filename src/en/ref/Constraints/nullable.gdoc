h1. nullable

h2. Purpose

Allows a property to be set to @null@. By default Grails does not allow @null@ values for properties.

h2. Examples

{code:java}
age nullable: true
{code}

h2. Description

Set to @true@ if the property allows @null@ values.

This constraint influences [schema generation|guide:gormConstraints].

Error Code: @className.propertyName.nullable@

{note}
Web requests resulting from form submissions will have blank strings, not @null@, for properties that have no value. Keep this in mind when doing mass property binding to properties that have been marked with @nullable: true@.  A blank string will validate for @nullable:true@ since the data binder will convert blank strings to null when binding to a constrained property which has been marked with @nullable: true@.
