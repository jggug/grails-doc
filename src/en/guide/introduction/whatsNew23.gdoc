h4. Improved Dependency Management

The default dependency resolution engine used by Grails has been changed to [Aether|http://eclipse.org/aether], the dependency resolution engine used by Maven. Which engine you use can be configured in @BuildConfig@:

{code}
grails.project.dependency.resolver = "maven" // or ivy
{code}

Using Aether dependency resolution in Grails results in the same behavior as when using the Maven build tool, meaning improved snapshot handling, understanding of custom packaging types and so on.

In addition, the [dependency-report|commandLine] command has been updated to print the dependency graph of the console, which helps in diagnosing dependency resolution failures. See the chapter on [Dependency Resolution|guide:dependencyResolution] for more information.
